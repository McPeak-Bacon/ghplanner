# üö® URGENT: Cloudflare Pages Deployment Fix

## The Problem
Your Cloudflare Pages is configured with a **deploy command** (`npx wrangler deploy`), which is causing deployment failures. Cloudflare Pages doesn't need a deploy command - it automatically deploys after the build completes.

## The Solution

### Step 1: Access Cloudflare Dashboard
1. Go to: https://dash.cloudflare.com
2. Click on **Pages** in the left sidebar
3. Click on your project: **githubplanner**

### Step 2: Update Build Configuration
1. Click **Settings** tab
2. Click **Builds & deployments**
3. Click **Edit configurations**

### Step 4: Fix the Settings
Update these fields EXACTLY as shown:

- **Build command**: `./build.sh`
- **Build output directory**: `.open-next/worker`
- **Deploy command**: ‚ö†Ô∏è **DELETE THIS FIELD COMPLETELY** (leave it empty)

### Step 5: Save and Retry
1. Click **Save**
2. Either:
   - Push a new commit to trigger deployment
   - OR click "View build" on the failed deployment and click "Retry deployment"

## Why This Fix Works

- **Cloudflare Pages** = Automatic deployment after build
- **Cloudflare Workers** = Requires `wrangler deploy` command
- Your project uses **Pages**, not Workers!

## Verification
After fixing, your next deployment should show:
```
‚úì Build command completed
‚úì Deploying to Cloudflare Pages...
‚úì Deployment successful!
```

Instead of the current error:
```
‚úò [ERROR] It looks like you've run a Workers-specific command in a Pages project.
```

## Need More Help?
If deployment still fails after this fix, check:
1. All environment variables are set in Pages settings
2. The build output directory is correct: `.open-next/worker`
3. The project type is set to "Pages" not "Workers"
