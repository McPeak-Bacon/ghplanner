## New: Authentication, Companies, and Projects (beta)

The app now includes a basic sign up / sign in flow (Credentials via NextAuth), multi-tenant Companies and Projects, member preferences and a draft auto-allocation API, plus task locking and PR-number support.

Quick start:

1. Environment
   - Set `MONGODB_URI` and `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` (or `JWT_SECRET`) in `.env`.
2. Run the app and visit `/signup` to create an account, then sign in at `/signin`.
3. Onboarding at `/onboarding`: create a company or join with a code.
4. Dashboard at `/dashboard`: manage projects and grab your join code.
5. Planner tasks now support locking (Edit ‚Üí Lock this task). Locked tasks can only be edited by the locker (admins/staff support coming next).
6. If a project is configured with a GitHub repo, the tasks API accepts `prNumber` to build the PR URL automatically.

API additions (beta):

- `POST /api/auth/signup` ‚Üí Create an account
- `GET/POST /api/companies` ‚Üí List or create companies
- `POST /api/companies/join` ‚Üí Join with code
- `GET/POST/PUT/DELETE /api/projects` ‚Üí Manage projects; `PUT` accepts `repoOwner`, `repoName`, and `repoToken`
- `GET/PUT /api/preferences` ‚Üí Save ranked project preferences
- `POST /api/allocations/preview` and `/api/allocations/commit` ‚Üí Greedy allocation
- Planner tasks `POST` now also accepts `{ prNumber, projectId }` and will derive `prUrl` if the project has a configured repo

Notes:

- Admin/staff role enforcement and full UI for assignments are being implemented next.
- Existing boards/tasks continue to work; new fields are optional for backward compatibility.
- **Containerized Deployment**: Full Podman/Docker support with development and production environments
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript implementation with comprehensive type definitions
- **SaaS-Grade UI**: Modern, accessible design with Tailwind CSS

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+
- Podman or Docker
- MongoDB (handled automatically in containerized setup)

### Local Development

1. **Clone and setup**:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd githubplanner
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

2. **Configure environment**:
   Edit `.env` with your settings:
   ```bash
   # Required for GitHub integration
   GITHUB_TOKEN=your_github_token_here

   # Required for authentication
   JWT_SECRET=your-secure-secret-here

   # Database (automatically configured for containers)
   MONGODB_URI=mongodb://admin:password@mongo:27017/github_planner?authSource=admin
   ```

3. **Start development environment**:
   ```bash
   ./run.sh dev
   ```

   This will:
   - Start MongoDB container
   - Start Next.js development server with hot reload
   - Bind mount source code for live editing

4. **Access the application**:
   - Application: http://localhost:3000
   - MongoDB: localhost:27017

### Production Deployment

```bash
./run.sh prod
```

This will:
- Build optimized production containers
- Start all services with health checks
- Run detached for production use

### Available Commands

```bash
./run.sh dev      # Start development environment
./run.sh prod     # Start production environment
./run.sh down     # Stop all services
./run.sh logs     # View logs (add service name for specific logs)
./run.sh status   # Check service status
./run.sh clean    # Clean up containers and volumes
./run.sh help     # Show detailed help
```
